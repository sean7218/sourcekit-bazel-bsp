# BazelProtobufBindings

Parsing action query output with protobuf format.

## Getting Started

1. To generate the Swift bindings, the proto definitions are needed, which can be copied from [https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/protobuf/analysis_v2.proto).
These definitions are stable and also versioned, thus it's safe to commit to the repository.

2. For building and installing the Code Generator Plugin, use Homebrew

```bash
brew install swift-protobuf
```

3. Swift bindings are generated by running `protoc` command and generated files are under Bindings folder

```bash
protoc --swift_out=. analysis_v2.proto --swift_opt=Visibility=Public
```
